    <h1>Nick Lewis</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, when I was contracting and moving jobs regularly I had a personal web site at this url.</p>
    <p>Now I have changed my working life to holding down a steady job for a long period of time I don't see the need to have a personal site in the same way, that's why this is just a placeholder.</p>
