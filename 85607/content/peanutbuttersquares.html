<h1>Peanut Butter Squares</h1><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Millionaires shortbread but with peanut butter and no cooking.</p><table><tr><th>Description</th><th>Quantity</th><th>UOM</th><th>Comment</th></tr><tr><td>Butter</td><td>150</td><td>g</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Peanut Butter</td><td>300</td><td>g</td><td>Smooth works but crunchy is more interesting</td></tr><tr><td>Chocolate</td><td>200</td><td>g</td><td>Dark or milk to taste</td></tr><tr><td>Digestive biscuits</td><td>250</td><td>g</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Soft light brown sugar</td><td>200</td><td>g</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Vanilla extract</td><td>1</td><td>tsp</td><td></td></tr></table><h2>Method</h2><p>Line tin with baking parchment leaving some excess paper hanging over the edges (this makes it easier to lift out once set).</p><p>Put the butter in a large pan and leave to melt slowly on a low heat.</p><p>Melt the chocalate</p><p>Remove the butter from the heat once melted.</p><p>Blitz the digestive biscuits and brown sugar in a blender or food processor to give fine crumbs. Tip them into the butter, scoop in the peanut butter and vanilla extract and mix well together, so everything is combined.</p><p>Tip the mixture into the lined tin and press it down hard with the back of a spoon. It needs to be really compact and tight. Then pour over the melted chocolate tilting the tin back and forth a bit so that the whole thing is evenly covered. Pop in the freezer for 30 minutes to firm up (or the fridge for 1 hour).</p><p>Once the chocolate has set, remove it from the freezer (or fridge). Lift it out of the tin with the help of the baking parchment. Remove the paper and then use a sharp knife to divide it into 16 squares to serve. These will last a few days in an airtight container.</p><h2>Final Comments</h2><p>
