<h1>Slow cooker Chicken</h1><h2>Introduction</h2><p>This is a way to cook a (small) whole chicken in the slow cooker, you can use the result just like a roast 
		chicken but it will be more moist and tender. Bear in mind if you are one who likes to eat the skin it'll be very pale and bland.</p><table><tr><th>Description</th><th>Quantity</th><th>UOM</th><th>Comment</th></tr><tr><td>Chicken</td><td>1</td><td>ea</td><td>A whole chicken of a size to fit comfortably in your slow cooker</td></tr><tr><td>Onion</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>A medium sized onion, you don't need a big one.</td></tr></table><h2>Method</h2><p>Slice the onion into rings and jumble them into the slow cooker.</p><p>Put the chicken on top and add 100ml or so of water</p><p>Cook on low until done, experience says 4 hours but the interior should reach 70C juices run clear and so on.</p><p>Discard the onions and use the stock to make gravy if you wish.</p><h2>Final Comments</h2><p>
			The onions are as much to make a space for the water under the bird as anything but they do seem to add a little flavour.
