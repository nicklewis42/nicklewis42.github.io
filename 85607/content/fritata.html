<h1>Fritata</h1><h2>Introduction</h2><p>A kind of caseless quiche cooked in a frying pan. Like a quiche the fillings can be pretty much 
		anything although the peas and potatoes are traditional ingedients. Fillings should all be cooked before 
		the eggs are added. Quantites should work in a medium sized pan and serve three or four. Note you need an
		oven proof frying pan for this.</p><table><tr><th>Description</th><th>Quantity</th><th>UOM</th><th>Comment</th></tr><tr><td>Eggs</td><td>6</td><td>ea</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cream</td><td>150</td><td>ml</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Grated Cheese</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td></td><td>Strong cheddar is good but whatever works for you.</td></tr><tr><td>Potatoes</td><td>500</td><td>g</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Peas</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td></td><td>optional</td></tr><tr><td>Bacon</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td></td><td>optional</td></tr><tr><td>Sausages</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td></td><td>optional</td></tr><tr><td>Mushrooms</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td></td><td>optional</td></tr><tr><td>Milk</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td></td><td>As required</td></tr></table><h2>Method</h2><p>Peel the potatoes and cut into half inch cubes.</p><p>Other than the eggs cream and cheese everything needs to be cooked before the eggs are added so boil/steam 
		the potatoes and peas, bacon veg etc. can be precooked or sauted in the pan before adding the eggs.</p><p>At about this point you should be putting the oven on at Gas 4, you don't wnat to put the pan into a cold oven.</p><p>Add everything except the cheese, eggs and cream to the hot pan, anything that needs cooking should go in first, fragile things (like peas) last.</p><p>While everything is still hot distribute the cooked meats and some chopped or grated cheese in the pan.</p><p>Beat the cream and eggs together and pour into the hot pan.</p><p>Heat on the hob until starting to cook round the edges then the pan goes into the preheated (Gas 4) oven.</p><p>Cook for about thirty minutes then turn over onto a plate slice and serve. DO NOT FORGET THE PAN HANDLE IS HOT!!!</p>
